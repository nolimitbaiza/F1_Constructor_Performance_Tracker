# F1 Constructor Performance by month from 1950 to 2025

## What this project does
This project turns raw Formula 1 race results into easy-to-read monthly summaries for each team (constructor). It:
- reads the raw CSV files,
- cleans them and adds a month label,
- adds up each teamâ€™s points per month,
- compares a month to the previous month (Month-over-Month growth),
- makes a chart that shows the Top 10 teams for any month you pick (like Aug 2012 or Apr 1993).

You can quickly see which team was strongest in a given month, and how their performance changed compared to the previous month.
